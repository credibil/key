//! # JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) Proofs
//!
//! This crate provides common utilities for the Credibil project and is not
//! intended to be used directly.
//!
//! [JOSE] proofs are enveloping proofs for Credentials based on JWT [RFC7519],
//! JWS [RFC7515], and JWK [RFC7517].
//!
//! The Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE [VC-JOSE-COSE]
//! recommendation defines a "bridge" between these and the Verifiable
//! Credentials Data Model v2.0, specifying the suitable header claims, media
//! types, etc.
//!
//! In the case of JOSE, the Credential is the "payload". This is preceded by a
//! suitable header whose details are specified by Securing Verifiable
//! Credentials using JOSE and COSE for the usage of JWT. These are encoded,
//! concatenated, and signed, to be transferred in a compact form by one entity
//! to an other (e.g., sent by the holder to the verifier). All the intricate
//! details on signatures, encryption keys, etc., are defined by the IETF
//! specifications; see Example 6 for a specific case.
//!
//! ## Note
//!
//! If the JWT is only a JWE, iss, exp and aud MUST be omitted in the JWT Claims
//! Set of the JWE, and the processing rules as per JARM Section 2.4 related to
//! these claims do not apply. [OpenID4VP] JWT - JWE
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "vp_token": "eyJI...",
//!   "presentation_submission": {...}
//! }
//! ```
